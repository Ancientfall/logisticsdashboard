# Date Parsing Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported that after previous fixes, they're only seeing data for January 2024, even though their Excel file contains data from December 2023 to April 2025. The dates in their Excel file are in M/D/YY format (e.g., "1/1/24").

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Excel Date Corruption**: When Excel dates in M/D/YY format are parsed, they're sometimes reduced to just the year value (e.g., "1/1/24" becomes just "24")
2. **Incorrect Default Handling**: The code was detecting these year-only values and defaulting ALL of them to January, causing all data to appear as January 2024
3. **Excel Reader Configuration**: The Excel reader was configured with `cellDates: false` which prevented proper date parsing

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Excel Reader Configuration
- Changed `cellDates` from `false` to `true` to enable proper date parsing
- Changed `raw` from `true` to `false` to allow XLSX library to format dates
- Added `dateNF: 'mm/dd/yyyy'` to ensure consistent date formatting

### 2. Improved Date Parsing Logic
- Added better detection for Excel serial dates (numbers > 40000)
- Enhanced debugging to log date parsing for first 10 records
- Added specific error messages when dates are corrupted

### 3. Data Quality Validation
- Added automatic data quality check when data is loaded
- Created specific check for "all dates are January" issue
- Added warnings for suspicious date distributions (>80% January)
- Integrated data quality popup that shows automatically when issues are detected

### 4. User Interface Improvements
- Added "Data Quality Check" button in the Export tab
- Data quality popup automatically shows when critical date issues are detected
- Provides clear recommendations for fixing date issues

## Recommendations for Users

If you encounter the "all dates showing as January" issue:

1. **Option 1: Format as Text in Excel**
   - Open your Excel file
   - Select the Month-Year column
   - Format cells as Text
   - Re-enter dates in MM-YY format (e.g., "01-24" for January 2024)
   - Save and re-upload

2. **Option 2: Use Proper Date Format**
   - Ensure the Month-Year column is formatted as Date in Excel
   - Use a consistent date format (e.g., 1/1/2024)
   - Excel should preserve the full date information

3. **Option 3: Use the Template**
   - Download the blank template from the Export tab
   - Copy your data into the template
   - The template has proper column formatting

## Technical Details

The issue occurs when:
- Excel interprets "1/1/24" as a date but only stores the year portion
- The XLSX library reads this as just "24"
- Our code sees "24" and has no way to determine the correct month
- Previously, we defaulted to January, causing all dates to appear as January 2024

The fix ensures:
- Dates are properly parsed by the XLSX library
- Data quality issues are immediately visible to users
- Clear guidance is provided for resolving date formatting issues
