## 📊 Core Fleet vs. Spot Vessel Analysis

### BP Core Fleet Definition
**Core OSV/PSV Fleet** (Standard Operations):
1. Dauphin Island ✅ - Core vessel (33 voyages, 5.5/month)
2. Pelican Island - Core vessel
3. Fantasy Island - Core vessel (Main Chemical/Production Vessel)
4. Squall ✅ - Core vessel (39 voyages, 6.5/month)
5. Lightning ✅ - Core vessel (35 voyages, 5.83/month)
6. Harvey Supporter ✅ - Core vessel (33 voyages, 5.5/month)
7. Ship Island ✅ - Core vessel (40 voyages, 6.67/month)
8. Tucker Candies - Core vessel (Mad Dog Warehouse Vessel)
9. Harvey Carrier - Core vessel

**Core FSV Fleet**:
1. Fast Goliath
2. Fast Leopard

*Note: Any vessels beyond this core fleet are considered "spot" or temporary assets*

### Vessel Performance Analysis by Fleet Type

#### Core Fleet Performance (OSV/PSV)
**Identified Core Vessels in Data**:
- **Ship Island**: 40 voyages (6.67/month) - Highest performing core vessel
- **Squall**: 39 voyages (6.5/month) - Strong core fleet reliability
- **Lightning**: 35 voyages (5.83/month) - Consistent core operations
- **Harvey Supporter**: 33 voyages (5.5/month) - Peak month: 8 voyages
- **Dauphin Island**: 33 voyages (5.5/month) - Consistent core performance

**Core Fleet Average**: 5.78 voyages/month/vessel (significantly above fleet average)

#### Non-Core/Spot Vessel Analysis
**Performance Gap**: Core vessels average 44% higher utilization than overall fleet average
**Implication**: Core fleet operates at optimal capacity while spot vessels show variable performance

### Underperforming Assets
- **3 vessels** are significantly underutilized (<2 voyages/month)
- These vessels represent potential redeployment opportunities
- Combined, they only contribute 5 voyages over 6 months

---

## 📅 Seasonal Patterns

### Monthly Voyage Distribution
- **Peak Months**: April (83 voyages), June (82 voyages), March (81 voyages)
- **Lower Months**: February (64 voyages), January (61 voyages)
- **Seasonal Variation**: ±15% from average
- **Weekly Average**: 12-14 voyages/week across the fleet

### Contract Rig Distribution
Most active contract rigs by voyage count:
- Thunder Horse Prod: 76 voyages
- Mad Dog Drilling: 64 voyages
- Ocean Blackhornet: 60 voyages
- Thunder Horse Drilling: 57 voyages
- Stena IceMAX: 55 voyages

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Core Fleet vs. Spot Fleet Capacity Planning
**Immediate Action**: Differentiate capacity assumptions by fleet type

**Core Fleet Capacity** (Primary Planning Basis):
- **Conservative Planning**: 5.5 voyages/month/vessel (core fleet average)
- **Realistic Planning**: 6 voyages/month/vessel (achievable core fleet target)
- **Optimistic Planning**: 6.5 voyages/month/vessel (top core fleet performance)

**Spot/Temporary Fleet Capacity** (Secondary/Variable):
- **Conservative Planning**: 3 voyages/month/vessel (spot vessel average)
- **Note**: Spot vessels should not be relied upon for baseline capacity planning

### 2. Fleet Optimization Opportunities
**Core Fleet Enhancement**:
- **Benchmark Best Practices**: Analyze Ship Island and Squall (core fleet leaders) operations for scalable efficiencies
- **Core Fleet Standardization**: Ensure all 9 core OSV/PSV vessels achieve minimum 5.5 voyages/month
- **Specialty Vessel Optimization**: Maximize Fantasy Island (chemical/production) and Tucker Candies (Mad Dog warehouse) efficiency

**Spot Fleet Management**:
- **Asset Redeployment**: Evaluate underutilized spot vessels for alternative deployment or retirement
- **Contract Strategy**: Use spot vessels for surge capacity and seasonal demand, not baseline planning

### 3. Operational Excellence Initiatives
**Focus Areas**:
- **Consistency Improvement**: Current top performers only achieve 61-68% consistency
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Optimize maintenance windows to minimize operational impact
- **Route Optimization**: Analyze high-performing vessel routes for replication

---

## ⚠️ Risk Considerations

### Capacity Overstatement Risk
- Current 6 voyage/month assumption **overstates fleet capacity by 33%**
- This could lead to:
  - Overcommitment to drilling programs
  - Inadequate vessel procurement planning
  - Unrealistic logistics cost projections

### Operational Variability
- **High vessel-to-vessel variation** (1-8 voyages/month range)
- **External factors** (weather, maintenance, operational delays) significantly impact realized capacity
- **Seasonal fluctuations** of ±15% from average monthly performance

---

## 🔧 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (Next 30 days)
1. **Update Planning Systems**: 
   - Core Fleet: 6 voyages/month/vessel baseline capacity
   - Spot Fleet: 3 voyages/month/vessel variable capacity
2. **Core Fleet Focus**: Prioritize planning around 9 core OSV/PSV + 2 core FSV vessels
3. **Stakeholder Communication**: Brief planning teams on core vs. spot fleet differentiation

### Phase 2: Optimization (Next 90 days)
1. **Best Practice Analysis**: Deep dive into Ship Island and Squall operations
2. **Underperformer Review**: Assess redeployment options for low-utilization vessels
3. **Route Optimization Study**: Analyze high-performer routes and scheduling patterns

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)
1. **Monthly Performance Tracking**: Monitor vessel utilization against revised targets
2. **Seasonal Adjustment Factors**: Develop month-specific capacity adjustments
3. **Predictive Maintenance**: Align maintenance schedules with operational patterns

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Short-term (3-6 months)
- **Improved Planning Accuracy**: 33% reduction in capacity overstatement
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Optimized vessel assignments based on actual performance
- **Enhanced Reliability**: More realistic logistics commitments to drilling programs

### Long-term (6-12 months)
- **Fleet Efficiency Gains**: Target 10-15% improvement in average fleet utilization
- **Cost Optimization**: Better vessel procurement and deployment decisions
- **Operational Excellence**: Systematic improvement in vessel consistency scores

## 📊 Data Quality and Methodology

### Data Scope
- **Total Records Analyzed**: 551 PSV/OSV manifest records
- **Vessel Count**: 18 active PSV/OSV vessels
- **Time Period**: 6 months (Jan-Jun 2025)
- **Filtering Criteria**: Excluded Fast vessels, focused on contract rig operations

### Methodology Notes
- Voyage counting based on unique Voyage IDs per vessel
- Monthly averages calculated based on active months only
- Consistency scores measure voyage distribution evenness across time periods
- Performance tiers based on statistical distribution analysis

### Limitations
- Analysis limited to first half of 2025 (seasonal patterns may vary in H2)
- External factors (weather, maintenance, market conditions) not individually quantified
- Assumes current operational model continues (no major fleet or routing changes)
