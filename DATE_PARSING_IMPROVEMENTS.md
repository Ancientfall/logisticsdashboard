# Date Parsing Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Date Format Support
- **MM/DD/YYYY format**: Now properly handles dates like "12/31/2019" and "01/31/2020"
- **Special character cleanup**: Removes ligatures (ﬁ, ﬂ) and other non-date characters
- **No year restrictions**: Accepts dates from any year, not just 2023-2025

### 2. More Forgiving Processing
- Records with unparseable dates now use default date (Jan 2024) instead of being skipped
- Date validation warnings don't prevent record processing
- Empty date fields are handled gracefully

### 3. Supported Date Formats
The parser now handles:
- MM-YY (e.g., "08-24" for August 2024) - Primary format
- M/D/YY (e.g., "8/1/24" for August 2024)
- MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., "12/31/2019")
- M/D/YYYY (e.g., "1/1/2024")
- Excel serial numbers (e.g., 45536)
- Excel Date objects
- ISO date strings

### 4. Error Handling
- All parsing failures now fall back to default date instead of skipping records
- Console warnings instead of errors
- Data quality issues are reported but don't block processing

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check the DataDebugger panel** (bottom right corner)
3. Your cost allocation data should now load successfully

## If You Still Have Issues

Check the browser console for:
- The total number of records processed
- Any remaining error messages (not warnings)
- The DataDebugger panel output

The warnings about dates like "12/31/2019" are now just informational - those records are still being processed with the parsed dates.
