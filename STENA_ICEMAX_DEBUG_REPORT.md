# Stena IceMAX Voyage Count Debug Report

## Issue Summary
The user expects to see 22 voyages for "Stena IceMAX" in May 2025, but the dashboard is showing 0 voyages.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Vessel Name Issue ‚ùå
**Finding:** The vessel "Stena IceMAX" does not exist in the voyage data.

**Evidence:**
- Total voyages in Excel file: 1,228
- Total unique vessels: 30
- Stena vessels found: 0
- IceMAX vessels found: 0
- Vessels containing both "stena" and "ice": 0

### 2. May 2025 Data Analysis üìä
**Total May 2025 voyages:** 86 voyages across 13 vessels

**Top vessels by voyage count in May 2025:**
1. Fast Leopard: 15 voyages
2. Fast Goliath: 14 voyages  
3. Squall: 7 voyages
4. Lightning: 7 voyages
5. Amber: 7 voyages
6. HOS Panther: 6 voyages
7. Pelican Island: 5 voyages
8. Tucker Candies: 5 voyages
9. Ship Island: 5 voyages
10. Dauphin Island: 5 voyages

**No vessel has exactly 22 voyages in May 2025.**

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Data File Mismatch
The user may be expecting data from a different dataset that contains "Stena IceMAX" voyages. The current Excel file (`Voyage List.xlsx`) may not be the complete or correct dataset.

### 2. Vessel Name Variation
"Stena IceMAX" might be recorded under a different name in the data, though no similar variants were found.

### 3. Date Range Issue
The expected 22 voyages might be from a different time period or the date parsing might have issues.

### 4. Data Processing Issue
There could be an issue in how the dashboard processes and filters the voyage data.

## Debugging Tools Implemented

### 1. VoyageDebugPanel Component
- **Location:** `/src/components/debug/VoyageDebugPanel.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Real-time vessel name and date filtering
  - Duplicate detection
  - Date issue identification
  - Detailed voyage listing
  - Console logging capability

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Logging
- **Location:** `VoyageAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Automatic Stena IceMAX logging when May 2025 is selected
  - Filter debugging information
  - Date parsing validation

### 3. Debug Button
- Added a red "Debug" button to the VoyageAnalyticsDashboard header
- Opens the VoyageDebugPanel for detailed analysis

### 4. Node.js Analysis Scripts
- `debug_voyage_data.js` - Direct Excel file analysis
- `debug_vessel_names.js` - Vessel name discovery
- `debug_may_2025_analysis.js` - May 2025 specific analysis

## How to Use the Debug Tools

### 1. Dashboard Debug Panel
1. Navigate to the Voyage Analytics Dashboard
2. Click the red "Debug" button in the top-right corner
3. Enter "Stena IceMAX" in the Vessel field
4. Enter "May 2025" in the Month field
5. Review the analysis results

### 2. Browser Console Debugging
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Navigate to Voyage Analytics Dashboard
3. Select "May 2025" from the month filter
4. Check console for "üö¢ STENA ICEMAX DEBUG" logs

### 3. Command Line Analysis
```bash
node debug_voyage_data.js     # Analyze Stena IceMAX specifically
node debug_vessel_names.js    # Show all vessel names
node debug_may_2025_analysis.js # Find vessels with 22 voyages
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Verify Data Source
- Confirm the correct Excel file is being used
- Check if there are additional voyage data files
- Verify the expected vessel name spelling

### 2. Check Data Processing
- Use the debug panel to verify data is loaded correctly
- Check if vessel names are being processed/standardized
- Verify date parsing is working correctly

### 3. Alternative Investigation
If "Stena IceMAX" should exist:
- Check the raw Excel file manually
- Look for similar vessel names that might be standardized
- Verify the voyage date range expectations

## Expected Outcome
Once the correct data source or vessel name is identified, the dashboard should display the expected 22 voyages for the correct vessel in May 2025.
