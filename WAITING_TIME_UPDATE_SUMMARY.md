# Waiting Time KPI Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the 'Waiting Time' KPI metric to exclude weather-related waiting events, making it a more actionable metric focused on controllable delays.

## Changes Made

### 1. ProductionDashboard.tsx
- **Line 111-114**: Updated calculation to only include 'Waiting on Installation' events
- **Previous**: Included both 'Waiting on Weather' and 'Waiting on Installation'
- **New**: Only includes 'Waiting on Installation'
- **Tooltip Updated**: Now states "Hours spent waiting on installation at production locations (excludes weather)"

### 2. DrillingDashboard.tsx
- **Line 353-362**: Modified filter to exclude any events containing 'Weather' in parentEvent
- **Added condition**: `!event.parentEvent?.includes('Weather')`
- **Tooltip Updated**: Now states "Time spent waiting on rig operations (excludes weather)"

### 3. metricsCalculation.ts
- Already correctly configured to exclude weather from waiting time
- No changes needed

## Metric Definitions After Update

### Waiting Time
- **Definition**: Time spent waiting on installation or rig operations only
- **Excludes**: Weather-related delays
- **Purpose**: Measures controllable operational delays
- **Lower is better**: Indicates more efficient operations

### Weather Impact (Separate Metric)
- **Definition**: Percentage of time spent waiting due to weather
- **Tracked separately**: Allows analysis of weather impact
- **Purpose**: Measures uncontrollable environmental delays

## Benefits of This Change

1. **More Actionable Metrics**: Waiting Time now represents delays that operations can potentially control or improve
2. **Clear Separation**: Weather delays are tracked separately, providing clearer insights
3. **Better Decision Making**: Management can focus on reducing installation-related delays while monitoring weather impact separately
4. **Accurate Performance Assessment**: Teams aren't penalized for weather delays outside their control

## Verification
To verify the changes:
1. Navigate to Production or Drilling Dashboard
2. Compare 'Waiting Time' with 'Weather Impact' metrics
3. Waiting Time should be lower than before (when it included weather)
4. Weather delays are still visible in the 'Weather Impact' percentage metric
