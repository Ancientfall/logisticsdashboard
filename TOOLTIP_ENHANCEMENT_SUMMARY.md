# Dashboard Tooltip Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Added intuitive tooltips to complex KPI metrics across all operational dashboards to improve user understanding of the metrics and their calculations.

## Changes Made

### ProductionDashboard.tsx
Added tooltips to 6 KPI metrics:
1. **Cargo Tons** - "Total cargo weight moved (Deck Tons + RT Tons) at production facilities. Higher values indicate increased operational activity."
2. **Productive Hours** - "Total hours classified as productive based on activity categorization. Includes cargo operations, loading, discharge, and other value-adding activities."
3. **Waiting Time** - "Hours spent waiting on installation or weather at production locations. Lower values indicate better operational efficiency."
4. **RT Cargo Tons** - "Round-trip cargo tonnage. Lower values may indicate more efficient one-way operations and better logistics planning."
5. **Weather Impact** - "Percentage of offshore time lost to weather-related delays. Lower values indicate less weather disruption to operations."
6. **Maneuvering Hours** - "Time spent on vessel positioning, setup, and shifting operations. Lower values indicate more efficient vessel handling."

### DrillingDashboard.tsx
Added tooltips to 7 KPI metrics:
1. **Cargo Tons** - "Total cargo weight moved (Deck Tons + RT Tons) at drilling locations. Indicates material supply intensity."
2. **Productive Hours** - "Hours spent on productive activities classified by operational category. Higher values indicate better time utilization."
3. **Waiting Time** - "Time spent waiting on rig operations or weather conditions. Lower values indicate better operational efficiency."
4. **Fluid Movement** - "Total wet bulk cargo movement in barrels. Includes bbls and converted gallons for comprehensive fluid tracking."
5. **Weather Impact** - "Percentage of rig time spent waiting due to weather conditions. Lower values indicate less weather disruption."
6. **Drilling Voyages** - "Complete round-trip voyages to drilling locations, including mixed-purpose trips. Higher counts indicate increased drilling support activity."
7. **Maneuvering Hours** - "Time spent on vessel positioning, anchor handling, and rig moves. Lower values indicate efficient positioning operations."

### VoyageAnalyticsDashboard.tsx
Added tooltips to 9 KPI metrics:
1. **Avg Duration** - "Average voyage duration in hours from port departure to final return. Shorter durations indicate better efficiency."
2. **Voyages/Vessel** - "Average number of voyages per active vessel in the period. Higher values indicate better vessel utilization."
3. **Multi-Stop %** - "Percentage of voyages with more than 2 stops. Higher values indicate complex routes serving multiple locations."
4. **On-Time %** - "Percentage of voyages completed within 2 hours of scheduled time. Higher values indicate better schedule reliability."
5. **Route Efficiency** - "Stops per day ratio. Higher values indicate more efficient route planning with better stop consolidation."
6. **Drilling Voyages** - "Percentage of total voyages dedicated to drilling operations. Indicates fleet allocation to drilling support."
7. **Mixed Efficiency** - "Percentage of voyages serving multiple purposes (drilling + production). Higher values show better trip consolidation."
8. **Fourchon Routes** - "Percentage of voyages originating from Fourchon port. Shows operational concentration from this key hub."
9. **Consolidation Benefit** - "Efficiency gain from consolidating multiple deliveries into single voyages. Higher values indicate better logistics optimization."

## Existing Tooltips (Already Implemented)
- **Lifts per Hour** (Production & Drilling) - Explains cargo lift efficiency
- **Vessel Utilization** (Production & Drilling) - Explains productive hours ratio
- **NPT Percentage** (Production & Drilling) - Explains non-productive time
- **Production Voyages** (Production) - Explains voyage counting methodology

## Additional Inline Tooltips
The ProductionDashboard also includes:
- Data breakdown tooltip explaining events vs manifests vs voyages
- Vessel visits tooltip explaining the relationship to voyages

## Design Consistency
All tooltips follow a consistent pattern:
- Concise 1-2 sentence explanations
- Focus on what the metric represents and how it's calculated
- Clear indication of whether higher or lower values are better
- Dark background with white text for readability
- Hover interaction with smooth transitions

## User Benefits
1. **Improved Understanding**: Users can quickly understand complex metrics without referring to documentation
2. **Context-Aware Guidance**: Tooltips explain whether higher or lower values are desirable
3. **Calculation Transparency**: Key metrics include brief calculation methodology
4. **Operational Insights**: Tooltips provide context about what each metric indicates operationally
