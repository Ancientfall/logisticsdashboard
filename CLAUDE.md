## Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start development server (runs on http://localhost:3000)
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a BP Logistics Analytics Dashboard built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application provides real-time analytics for offshore drilling and production operations.

### State Management
- **Context API** is used for global state management with three main contexts:
  - `DataContext`: Core data operations and state
  - `DashboardContext`: Dashboard-specific state and filters
  - `NotificationContext`: User notification system

### Data Flow
1. **Excel files** are uploaded through the FileUpload component
2. **Processors** in `src/processors/` validate and transform data
3. **Dexie (IndexedDB)** stores processed data persistently
4. **Context providers** distribute data to components
5. **Dashboard components** visualize and interact with data

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Component organization**: Features are grouped by domain (dashboard/, layout/, ui/)
- **Type safety**: All data structures have TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/`
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling with fallback UI
- **Custom hooks**: Business logic is extracted into reusable hooks
- **Data processing**: Modular processors handle different data types independently

### BP Design System
- Primary color: `#00754F` (BP green)
- Secondary color: `#6EC800` (bright green)
- Typography: Inter font family
- Spacing: Use Tailwind's spacing scale
- Components: Leverage NextUI with BP brand customization

### Testing Approach
- Jest with React Testing Library
- Test files: `__tests__/` directories or `.test.ts/tsx` suffix
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on user interactions and component behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Large datasets are processed client-side
- IndexedDB for persistent storage avoids re-processing
- React.memo for expensive component renders
- Virtual scrolling for large lists (when implemented)

## Implementation Memories

### Latest Deployment Memory ‚è∫ ‚úÖ Complete Implementation Successfully Deployed!

üéâ What We've Accomplished:

‚úÖ Server-Side Excel File Loading System
- Created useServerFileLoader hook for seamless server integration
- Uploaded all 5 required Excel files to VPS server (4.4MB total)
- Implemented automatic file download and processing pipeline

‚úÖ Enhanced Landing Page Experience
- "View Analytics" button now automatically loads server data
- Smart UI that adapts based on server file availability
- Loading states and error handling for better UX
- Maintained fallback to manual upload if needed

‚úÖ Complete Production Deployment
- All files deployed to VPS with PM2 management
- API endpoints tested and functional
- Cache-busting implemented for instant updates
- Domain ready at https://bpsolutionsdashboard.com

üöÄ User Experience Now:

1. Visit Landing Page ‚Üí Clean white design loads
2. Click "View Analytics" ‚Üí Automatic server file loading begins
3. Processing Indicator ‚Üí Shows "Loading Data..." during processing
4. Dashboard Access ‚Üí Direct redirect to fully loaded analytics

üîß Technical Architecture:

Excel Files (VPS) ‚Üí API Endpoint ‚Üí Client Download ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Dashboard
               ‚Üì
       Fallback: Manual Upload ‚Üí Same Processing ‚Üí Dashboard

üìã Next Steps:

1. Clear Cloudflare Cache to see new functionality immediately
2. Test "View Analytics" button from landing page
3. Verify Dashboard Access with pre-loaded data
