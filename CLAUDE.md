## Architecture Overview

This is a BP Logistics Analytics Dashboard built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application provides real-time analytics for offshore drilling and production operations.

### State Management
- **Context API** is used for global state management with three main contexts:
  - `DataContext`: Core data operations and state
  - `DashboardContext`: Dashboard-specific state and filters
  - `NotificationContext`: User notification system

### Data Flow
1. **Excel files** are loaded from local Excel server (`localhost:5001`) or manually uploaded
2. **Server integration** via `useServerFileLoader` hook automatically downloads files from server
3. **Modular processors** in `src/utils/processors/` validate and transform data:
   - `voyageEventProcessor.ts`: Processes voyage events with LC allocation
   - `vesselManifestProcessor.ts`: Handles manifest data with location mapping
   - `costAllocationProcessor.ts`: Processes cost allocation with vessel costs
   - `voyageListProcessor.ts`: Processes voyage list with segment analysis
4. **IndexedDB (Dexie)** stores processed data persistently via `indexedDBManager.ts`  
5. **Context providers** (DataContext, DashboardContext, NotificationContext) distribute data
6. **Dashboard components** visualize and interact with data
7. **Automatic navigation** redirects users to analytics after successful data loading

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Excel Server Integration**: Local Express server (`simple-excel-server.js`) serves Excel files for development
- **Component organization**: Features are grouped by domain (dashboard/, layout/, ui/, admin/)
- **Type safety**: All data structures have TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling with fallback UI
- **Custom hooks**: Business logic is extracted into reusable hooks (`useDataOperations`, `useServerFileLoader`)
- **Modular processors**: Each data type has its own processor with validation and transformation
- **Data storage**: Dual storage with IndexedDB for persistence and Context API for state
- **Business logic separation**: Complex logic like LC allocation, vessel cost calculation, and activity classification is extracted into utility modules
- **Streamlined UX**: Single `EnhancedFileUploadWithServer` component handles all data loading scenarios

### BP Design System
- Primary color: `#00754F` (BP green)
- Secondary color: `#6EC800` (bright green)
- Typography: Inter font family
- Spacing: Use Tailwind's spacing scale
- Components: Leverage NextUI with BP brand customization

### Testing Approach
- Jest with React Testing Library
- Test files: `__tests__/` directories or `.test.ts/tsx` suffix
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on user interactions and component behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Large datasets are processed client-side with chunked processing
- IndexedDB for persistent storage avoids re-processing uploaded data
- React.memo for expensive component renders
- Modular processors allow parallel processing of different data types
- Business logic utilities use Map-based lookups for O(1) performance
- Excel server approach eliminates file upload time (direct loading from localhost:5001)
- Request timeouts (5s) and proper cleanup prevent hanging operations
- Single server file check on component mount (no polling loops)

## Development Standards

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Processors**: Business logic for data transformation (`src/utils/processors/`)
- **Utilities**: Pure functions for calculations (`src/utils/lcAllocation.ts`, `src/utils/vesselCost.ts`)
- **Hooks**: Reusable React hooks for data operations (`src/hooks/`)
- **Context**: Global state management (`src/context/`)
- **Types**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces (`src/types/index.ts`)

### Key Business Logic Modules

#### Cost Allocation & LC Processing
- **File**: `src/utils/lcAllocation.ts`
- **Purpose**: Processes LC (Location Code) allocation with percentage-based splitting
- **Key Function**: `processLCAllocations()` - Maps voyage events to cost allocation data

#### Vessel Cost Calculation  
- **File**: `src/utils/vesselCost.ts`
- **Purpose**: Calculates vessel costs using daily rates and time periods
- **Key Function**: `calculateVesselCost()` - Applies rates based on dates

#### Activity Classification
- **File**: `src/utils/activityClassification.ts` 
- **Purpose**: Classifies vessel activities as productive/non-productive
- **Key Function**: `classifyActivity()` - Uses parent event + event classification

#### Data Processing Pipeline
- **File**: `src/utils/dataProcessing.ts`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire data processing workflow
- **Key Functions**: `processUploadedFiles()`, `processFilesByType()`

#### Vessel Codes Processing
- **File**: `src/utils/vesselCodesProcessor.ts`
- **Purpose**: Processes vessel codes for proper activity classification
- **Integration**: Works with cost allocation for authoritative data source

### Data Validation and Quality
- **Data Integrity**: `src/utils/dataIntegrityValidator.ts` validates cross-references
- **Excel Validation**: `src/utils/excel/excelValidator.ts` validates file formats
- **Quality Reporting**: Built-in validation reporting for data quality metrics

### Storage Architecture
- **IndexedDB Manager**: `src/utils/storage/indexedDBManager.ts` handles persistence
- **Simple Data Store**: `src/types/simpleDataStore.ts` provides type-safe data structure
- **Debug Utils**: `src/utils/storage/debugUtils.ts` for troubleshooting storage issues

## Important Implementation Notes

### CostAllocation.xlsx as Master Data Source
- CostAllocation.xlsx serves as the authoritative source for location determination
- All LC-based filtering and location mapping should reference cost allocation data
- Use `costAllocationProcessor.ts` for proper LC validation and mapping

### Modular Processor Architecture
- Each Excel file type (Voyage Events, Manifests, etc.) has its own processor
- Processors are designed to be independent but can cross-reference each other
- Always process CostAllocation first as it provides master reference data

### Business Logic Separation  
- Complex calculations are extracted into utility modules (not in React components)
- Use TypeScript interfaces extensively for type safety
- Business rules are centralized in utility functions for reusability

## Implementation Memories

### Excel Server Integration & Upload Streamlining ‚è∫ ‚úÖ Streamlined Data Loading Workflow!

üéâ What We've Accomplished:

‚úÖ **Fixed Excel Server Polling Issues**
- **Root Cause**: Multiple components were calling `checkServerFiles()` on mount causing excessive polling

**1. Site Returns 404/502**:
```bash
# Check PM2 process status
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "pm2 list"

# If stopped, restart PM2
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "pm2 restart bp-logistics-dashboard"

# Check server logs for errors
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "pm2 logs bp-logistics-dashboard"
```

**2. Excel Files Not Loading**:
```bash
# Verify Excel files exist
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "ls -la /var/www/logisticsdashboard/excel-data/excel-files/"

# Test API endpoint directly
curl -s "https://bpsolutionsdashboard.com/api/excel-files"

# Check file permissions
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/logisticsdashboard"
```

**3. Outdated Build Deployed**:
```bash
# Verify latest build files
curl -s https://bpsolutionsdashboard.com | grep -o 'main\.[a-f0-9]*\.js'

# Compare with local build
ls -la build/static/js/main.*.js

# If different, redeploy using deployment script
./deploy-with-sshpass.sh
```

**4. Nginx Configuration Issues**:
```bash
# Test Nginx configuration
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "sudo nginx -t"

# Reload Nginx
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "sudo systemctl reload nginx"

# Check Nginx logs
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP "sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log"
```

### Server Dependencies

**Required Node.js Packages** (installed on server):
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "path-to-regexp": "^6.2.1"
  }
}
```

**Installation Commands** (if needed):
```bash
# SSH into server
sshpass -p "$VPS_SSH_PASSWORD" ssh $VPS_SSH_USER@$VPS_SERVER_IP

# Navigate to app directory
cd /var/www/logisticsdashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install express@4.18.2 path-to-regexp@6.2.1
```
